## Caesar Cipher 

The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption techniques, named after the famous Roman general and statesman, Julius Caesar. This classical method of encryption has intrigued scholars and enthusiasts alike for centuries, serving as a fundamental concept in the field of cryptography. The cipher operates on a straightforward principle of letter substitution, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This systematic approach not only provides a basic understanding of how encryption works but also lays the groundwork for more advanced cryptographic methods used in modern-day communication.

In this project, I created a Python program that performs the following functions:
- Encrypts a given message using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts an encrypted message using the same algorithm.
- Allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform both encryption and decryption.

To illustrate the program's functionality, consider the following interaction:

1. **User Input:**
   Enter your message: hello world  
   Enter the shift value: 4  

2. **Output:**
   Encrypted text is lipps asvph  
   Decrypted text is hello world
